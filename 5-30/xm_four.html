				<p id="gs">The goal is to expand and extend the green landscape space for the closed circular community, provide three positioning points using the architectural theory of acupuncture and moxibustion therapy, and combine the functions of stall retail, drying clothes, planting and sightseeing.</p>
				<p>The design inspiration comes from the concept of acupuncture and moxibustion therapy, that is, to adjust the energy and balance of the body by pressing specific acupoints. We apply this concept to the community environment, using green landscape spaces as "acupoints" to create three positioning points in the community.</p>
				<p>The first positioning point is the stall retail area, which focuses on commercial activities and provides a small market for community residents. This area will have flexible stall spaces that can accommodate local residents and entrepreneurs to sell various goods and food. This not only provides a convenient shopping place, but also promotes communication and interaction among community residents.</p>
				<p>The second positioning point is the clothes drying area, which will provide convenient drying facilities for residents to dry clothes and household items. We will design a drying structure with aesthetic value to make it one of the highlights of the community. At the same time, this area can also serve as a place for community residents to communicate and increase interpersonal interaction in the community.</p>
				<p>The third positioning point is the planting and viewing area, which will provide a beautiful green space for residents to relax and appreciate. Design multi-layered gardens and landscape areas, plant various flowers and plants, and set up chairs and paths for people to walk and relax. This area will provide community residents with a place close to nature, enhancing the ecological environment and beauty of the community.</p>
