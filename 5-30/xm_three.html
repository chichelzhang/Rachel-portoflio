				<p id="jj">Wenzhou Huaniao Market Miaoguosi Guwan Building, Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, China </p>

				<p id="gs">Taking the long-standing Wenzhou Miaoguo Temple antique market as the background and inspired
					by the art restoration of Kintsugi, the plan is to renovate the buildings in the antique market
					through integration and embedding. Using childlike brushstrokes, depict a commercial building that
					integrates woodworking toy workshops, antique retail, tea drinks, and restoration functions</p>
				<p>The design intention is to inject modern elements and creative concepts while preserving the original
					architectural style. The appearance will adopt the curved roofs and traditional materials of
					traditional architecture to preserve the historical characteristics of the antique market. At the
					same time, we will use the aesthetic concept of Kintsugi art, metal elements, and special
					restoration techniques to create unique textures and lighting effects on the exterior walls of
					buildings, showcasing historical traces and precious restoration processes.</p>
				<p>The internal space will include a woodworking toy workshop, antique retail area, tea area, and
					restoration studio. The woodworking toy workshop will provide an interactive creative space where
					people can personally participate in making woodworking toys and experience the fun of handicrafts.
					The antique retail area will showcase and sell antiques and treasures from different periods and
					regions, providing a unique shopping experience for collectors and cultural explorers. The tea
					drinking area will provide a combination of traditional tea ceremony and modern tea drinks, allowing
					people to appreciate the beauty of the antique market while savoring tea culture. The restoration
					studio will provide professional restoration services to restore antiques and cultural relics to
					their original and beautiful state, showcasing the charm and value of restoration art.</p>
