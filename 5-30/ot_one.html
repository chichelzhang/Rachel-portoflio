				<p id="jj">During my university years, I indulged in the art of travel scenery illustrations, classical masterpieces sketches, and captivating portraits of my fellow classmates. These artistic endeavors hold a special place in my heart, reminding me of the serene and aesthetically enriching memories I experienced while exploring the picturesque landscapes of Yunnan, China.</p>
				<p>Yunnan, with its majestic snow-capped mountains, pristine plateaus, meandering streams, vibrant Dai ethnic water festivals, and abundant sunshine, provided a perfect sanctuary for relaxation and inspiration. Each stroke of my brush or pencil in my travel scenery illustrations effortlessly transports me back to those carefree days, where I found solace and tranquility amidst nature's wonders.</p>
				<p>Furthermore, my passion for art extended to studying and sketching classical masterpieces. Immersed in art history classes, I delved into the works of renowned masters and reveled in the challenge of replicating their brilliance through intricate sketches. These exercises allowed me to capture the essence of these timeless pieces, with every line and shade revealing the intricate details and emotions within.</p>
				<p>Lastly, capturing the essence of my fellow classmates through portraiture became a cherished endeavor. Each portrait became a unique fusion of artistic interpretation and personal connection, immortalizing the vibrant personalities and shared experiences we treasured during our university journey.</p>
