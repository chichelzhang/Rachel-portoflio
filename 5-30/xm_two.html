Design inspiration comes from traditional Chinese culture and village lifestyle, aiming to create a multifunctional space that not only meets the needs of celebration activities, but also promotes communication and interaction among people from different regions.</p>
				<p>The building will be based on the traditional architectural style of Shangzhuang Village in Wenzhou, incorporating modern design elements. The appearance will adopt traditional village tile roofs and wooden structures to highlight regional characteristics, and use sustainable materials and technologies to improve energy efficiency and environmental sustainability.</p>
				<p>The internal space will be flexibly arranged according to different functional requirements. The main functions include indoor celebration halls, exhibition spaces, entertainment public spaces, etc. The celebration hall will provide sufficient space to host various activities, such as traditional festival celebrations, artistic performances, and cultural exhibitions.
